### Data Sources

[Data dictionary](https://eerscmap.usgs.gov/uswtdb/api-doc/) for the wind turbine data (wind_turbine_20220114.csv).

Data on operators within the U.S. energy space. Data is from [here](https://www.eia.gov/electricity/data/eia923/) (2022: EIA-923
January 2022 zip file).

### Data cleaning and Preperation

In the intiial data preperation phase, we performed the following tasks:
1. Data loading and inspection
2. Handling null values
3. Data cleaning and formatting

### Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA involved in exploring U.S. wind turbine market

- How many wind turbines are contained in the U.S. Wind Turbine Database?
- Average wind speeds in the U.S.A
- Should you invest in the wind market? If so, who should you
approach to fund?
- Key trends in the U.S. wind market: Land-Based Wind Market Report
  

### Data Analysis

For this group data sprint we researched the renewable energy industry and wind turbines to understand what wind
turbines are, how they work (at a high level), and why they are used.
